# Simplify Gmail Native

Run [Simplify / Gmail](https://simpl.fyi/gmail/) as a standalone app using [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier#readme).

This is useful if you want to be able to keep your email separate from your million other browser tabs.

## Installation

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidguttman/simplify-gmail-native/master/install.sh | bash
```

Or just grab [install.sh](https://github.com/davidguttman/simplify-gmail-native/blob/master/install.sh) and run it.

## Notes

This assumes you're running OSX, but you should be able to tweak the install script so that it works on Windows (replace the `gmail.icns` file with a PNG, and download the `script.js` and `style.css` files manually, etc...)
